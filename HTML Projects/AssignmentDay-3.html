    <p>It is said that Mathematics is the gate and key of the Science. According to the famous Philosopher Kant, “A Science is exact only in so far as it employs Mathematics”. So, all scientific education which does not commence with Mathematics is said to be defective at its foundation. Neglect of mathematics works injury to all knowledge.

        One who is ignorant of mathematics cannot know other things of the World. Again, what is worse, who are thus ignorant are unable to perceive their own ignorance and do not seek any remedy. So Kant says, “A natural Science is a Science in so far as it is mathematical”. And Mathematics has played a very important role in building up modern Civilization by perfecting all Science.It is said that Mathematics is the gate and key of the Science.
